### Project 1: House Price Prediction
Predicts house prices using features like area, bedrooms, location, etc.

- Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (you can switch)
- Real-time prediction via Flask web app
- Modern, responsive UI

Project 2: Plagiarism Detector (LIVE WEB APP)
Detects plagiarized text using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

Trained on real plagiarism dataset
95%+ accuracy
Cyberpunk glassmorphism design
Dark mode, animations, pure drip
Real-time detection

Run:
Bashcd plagiarism-detector
pip install flask scikit-learn nltk pandas
python app.py
