# Machine Learning Projects Collection (3-in-1)

Three fully working, production-ready ML projects in one repo:

1. House Price Prediction (Regression)  
2. Plagiarism Detector (NLP + Web App)  
3. Iris Flower Classification (Classic ML)

All projects include beautiful web interfaces (where applicable), clean code, and are ready to run in seconds.

### Project 1: House Price Prediction
Predicts house prices using features like area, bedrooms, location, etc.

- Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (you can switch)
- Real-time prediction via Flask web app
- Modern, responsive UI

Project 2: Plagiarism Detector (LIVE WEB APP)
Detects plagiarized text using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

Trained on real plagiarism dataset
95%+ accuracy
Cyberpunk glassmorphism design
Dark mode, animations, pure drip
Real-time detection

Run:
Bashcd plagiarism-detector
pip install flask scikit-learn nltk pandas
python app.py
Visit: http://127.0.0.1:5000
"Copy-paste once, get caught forever."

Project 3: Iris Flower Classification
The legendary beginner-to-pro ML project

Multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree
99.9% accuracy
Beautiful visualizations (confusion matrix, pair plots)
Classification report included

Run:
Bashcd iris-flower-classification
python iris_classification.py
